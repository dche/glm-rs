//! Functions that extend the functionalities of GLSL data types.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! - Unlike built-in functions, extension functions are not re-exported to
//!   the root module of `glm`. You have to `use glm::ext`.
//! - Also unlike the built-in functions, the naming of extension functions
//!   follows the Rust convention, instead of the GLSL's. That is, snake case
//!   is used.
//! - The parameters of matrix related functions are passed by reference.
